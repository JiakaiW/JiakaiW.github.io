# qLDPC is neccessary

One is either PsiQuantum-pilled or hardware-qLDPC code co-design is needed. Specifically, 3D integration of superconducting qubits gives oppotunities of more complex connectivity. Another interesting direction of development is long-range connectivity or reconfigurable bus. 

I'm also interested in the physical implementation of other qubit modalities. Although I previously specialize in superconducting qubits, I'm also curious about integrated photonics, QCCD ion traps platforms.
