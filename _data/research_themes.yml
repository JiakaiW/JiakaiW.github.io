# Research Themes Configuration
# Stats (completed/ongoing/potential counts) are automatically calculated from projects.yml
# To add a new theme:
# 1. Add an entry here with id, title, description, and icon path
# 2. Create the icon SVG in /assets/icons/themes/
# 3. Add projects to _data/projects.yml with this theme ID in the "themes" array
