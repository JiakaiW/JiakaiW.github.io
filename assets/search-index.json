Rev. A 108, 062426 ‚Äì Published 26 December 2023 [slides at APS march meeting 2024](/files/2023/APSMM24_MFQEC.pdf) **Why measurement-free quantum error correction (MFQEC):** Quantum error correction (QEC) can be understood as pumping out entropy, and there's no rule that predicts measurement is necessary. Because the photon-scattering effect during neutral atom qubit measurement is detrimental to nearby qubit coherence, it would be advantageous if near-term small-scale QEC protocols don't rely on measurements. (Another approach to mitigate the adverse effect of measurement is to use atom movement and dedicated readout zones.) **Challenges in MFQEC:** Even for measurement-based protocols, unreliable syndrome measurement requires special gadgets, including surface code, where lattice surgery requires multiple rounds of measurements to ensure fault-tolerance. (Although recent proposals of algorithmic fault-tolerance change this.) How to perform this classical processing with unreliable syndrome measurement using purely quantum operations is the crucial problem in MFQEC. We find the Steane code augmentated with a) syndrome redundancy b) native multi-qubit gates c) logical ancilla to be fault-tolerance with realistic error from gate simulation. The quantum circuit diagram for implementing measurement-free quantum error correction. **Acknowledgements:** I'm super grateful for Michael, Mark and Bob who let me participate in this project! This is my first paper and tought me quantum error correction theroy, hamiltonian simulation, and gave me motivation to learn some of the recent developments like resource estimation, Flag scheme, biased noise and erasure conversion although I didn't use them in this project."

While erasure qubits have been demonstrated on natural atoms or composite superconducting qubits, it will be cool if erasure qubit can be implemented on single-mode superconducting qubits. **We demonstrate that a single fluxonium artificial atom can be used as an erasure qubit, along with proposals for physical gates** ### Paper coming soon [APS March Meeting 2024 Fluxonium leakage detection, https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR24/Session/A49.8](/files/2024/APSMM24_fluxonium.pdf) [IMSI quantum hardware workshop poster 2024](/files/2024/leakage_detection_poster.pdf) Fluxonium has a more complex potential and selection rules than transmon. We utilize the selection rule in integer fluxonium to enhance the computational subspace coherence time and do trade-off with leakage process. ## a) Two-outcome leakage detection measurement via tunable resonator Dispersive readout can be used to detect leakage without harming qubit coherence in fluxonium. See analytical and numerical analysis on dephasing in the coming paper. ## b) Two-outcome leakage detection measurement via transmon By adjusting non-linear resonator frequency and drive amplitude, we get another \"degree of freedom\" in the control compared to resonator based readout, making leakage detection less demanding on parameter selection. ## c) \"Erasure-bias\" preserving gates Coherence time estimation shows that g-f I nteger F luxonium Q ubit (g-f IFQ) is an erasure-dominant qubit with super-long computational subspace coherence time, this feature needs to be preserve in gate operations. We show that by using large enough detuning, intermediate state decay is minimized, and additional leakage can be converted to erasure by the aforementioned leakage detection measurement via transmon. This established g-f IFQ as an erasure qubit."
