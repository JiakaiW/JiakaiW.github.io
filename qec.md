# Measurement-free steane code with neutral atom multi-qubit gates

I'm super grateful for Michael, Mark and Bob who let me participate in this project! This is my first paper and tought me quantum error correction theroy, hamiltonian simulation, and gave me motivation to learn some of the recent developments like resource estimation, Flag scheme, biased noise and erasure conversion although I didn't use them in this project.
