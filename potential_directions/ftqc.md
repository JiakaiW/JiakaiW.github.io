# Faul-Tolerant Quantum Computing

As of October 2024, tremendous progress has been made on qLDPC code architectures and their logical gate operations. 

**But there are still some questions I'm curious about, including:**

a) qLDPC w/ FBQC integrated photonics? 

b) Simpler qLDPC designs based (not too far-fetched) reconfigurable bus + TSVs for superconducting qubits? 

c) I'm sort of curious about the routing problem of implementing qLDPC or even just surface code on QCCD ion traps.
