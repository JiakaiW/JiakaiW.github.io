# Immature ideas:

**Automated circuit-level Quantum Error Correction Protocol Discovery**: With [(reference))](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-11-07-1172/), can new QEC protocol be discovered with some learning agents?

**Can new ideas on LLM usage enable LLM to do quantum computing research?** Can multi-agent + RAG + novel prompt engineering + more "thinking" enabled by reduced cost of inference enable LLM to write code for hamiltonian simulation / QEC simulation? Although this paper: [Embers of Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638) predicts LLM can't do well on things they are not trained upon, but is it really impossible?
