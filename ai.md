But seriously, I'm very interested in the deployment and prompt engineering of LLMs. Specifically, to develop LLM application that aid quantum computing research, domain expertise is needed and here I am uniquely positioned understanding both worlds!

Things that can be enhanced include: quantum-EDA, gate-level QEC protocol discovery (thanks to the proposal of "detecting regions"), fault-tolerant operation optimization.
